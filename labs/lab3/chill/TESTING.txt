Testing:
I simply tested the program by testing the following:
-no arguments
-1 argument with temp below 50
-1 argument with temp above 50
-1 argument with temp not a number (letters)
-2 arguments with temp and speed both in appropriate range
-2 arguments with temp in incorrect range only
-2 arguments with speed in incorrect range only
-2 arguments with both in incorrect ranges
-2 arguments with letters instead of numbers
-more than 2 arguments

These were all of the possibilities that I could think of.
I didn't used any test scripts, but rather tested manually on the command line.

Here is some output of these tests:
